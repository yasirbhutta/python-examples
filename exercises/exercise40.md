**Problem: FizzBuzz**

**Problem Statement:**
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to `n`. But for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

**Input:**
- The first and only line contains the integer `n`.

**Output:**
- Print numbers from 1 to `n`, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".

**Example:**

**Input:**
```
15
```

**Output:**
```
1
2

4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz

```
