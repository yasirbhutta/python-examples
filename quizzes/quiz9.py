# This program defines a function 'is_palindrome' that checks whether a given string is a palindrome.
# The function takes a string argument 's'.
# The function returns True if the string 's' is equal to its reverse, and False otherwise.
# The function is called with the string "racecar".
# The return value of the function, which is True in this case, is not printed or stored.
