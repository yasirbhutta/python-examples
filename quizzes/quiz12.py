# This program performs a series of arithmetic operations using integer values.
# The operations are performed in the order they appear in the expression, using standard operator precedence rules.
# The first operation is 2 raised to the power of 3, which results in 8.
# The second operation is 4 divided by 2, using integer division, which results in 2.
# The third operation is the addition of 8 and 2, which results in 10.
# The final operation is the subtraction of 1 from 10, which results in 9.
# The value of the final expression, 9, is not printed or stored.
