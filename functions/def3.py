# This program defines a function called 'find_length' that takes a string argument 'word'.
# The function initializes a variable 'length' to 0 to count the number of characters in the string.
# The function then iterates over each character in the string using a for loop.
# For each character, the function increments the value of 'length' by 1.
# After all characters have been counted, the function returns the value of 'length'.
# The function call 'find_length("python language")' passes the string "python language" as an argument.
# The function returns the value 15, which is the length of the string "python language".
